The <strong>economic indicators</strong> included in this lesson are of a practical importance 
for trading on <strong>foreign exchange markets</strong>. While these indicators are generally applicable economic terms,
some of them are specific for the country of their release.</div>
<h2><a name="auto_sales">Auto Sales</a></h2>
 <div class="textarea">The number of cars sold during a particular ten-day period. The timeliness of this indicator makes this 
the most current piece of US economic data.</div>
<h2><a name="balance_payment">Balance of Payments</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Complete summary of a nation&rsquo;s economic transactions and the rest of the world 
including merchandise, services, financial assets and tourism. The balance of payments is separated into 
two main accounts: the current account and the capital account.</div>
<h2><a name="balance_trade">Balance of Trade</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">The difference between a nation&rsquo;s exports and imports of merchandise. A positive balance of trade, or a 
surplus, occurs when a country&rsquo;s exports exceed its imports. A negative balance of trade, or a deficit, 
occurs when imports surpass exports.</div> 

<h2><a name="beige_book">Beige Book</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Information on current economic and business conditions in the districts defined by the Federal Reserve 
Bank, and interviews with key business contacts, economists, market experts, and other sources. The Beige 
Book usually serves as a helpful indicator to Federal Open Market Committee, and it is released prior to 
each FOMC meeting concerning the determination of the interest rates in USA.</div>
<h2><a name="bis">Business Inventories and Sales</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Data from other reports such as durable goods orders, factory orders, retail sales, and wholesale 
inventories and sales data. Inventories are an important component of the GDP report because they help 
distinguish which part of total output produced remained unsold.</div>
 

<h2><a name="capital_acc">Capital Account</a></h2>
 <div class="textarea">Records a nation&rsquo;s incoming and outgoing investment flows such as payments for entire or parts of 
companies (direct or portfolio investment), stocks, bonds, bank accounts, real estate and factories. 
The balance of payments is influenced by many factors, including the financial and economic climate of 
other countries.</div>

<h2><a name="constr_spend">Construction Spending</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Construction spending measures the value of construction during the course of a 
particular month.</div>
<h2><a name="cpi">Consumer Price Index</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Measures the change in prices at the consumer level for a fixed basket of goods and services paid for by 
a typical consumer. Items included in the CPI reflect prices of food, clothing, shelter, fuels, 
transportation, health care and all other goods and services that people buy for day-to-day living. These 
items are divided into seven categories: housing, food, transportation, medical care, apparel, 
entertainment, and other; each of which is weighted by their relative importance. Since food and energy 
prices could fluctuate due to conditions that are unrelated to the economy &ndash; such as weather, oil supply 
or wars &ndash; it is important to break down the factors impacting the change in prices.</div>
<h2><a name="curr_acc">Current Account</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">The most important part of international trade data. It is the broadest measure of sales and purchases of 
goods, services, interest payments and unilateral transfers.
<b>Durable Goods Orders</b> - These include large ticket items such as capital goods (machinery, plant and equipment), transportation 
and defense orders. They are extremely important in that they anticipate changes in production and thus, 
signal turns in the economic cycle.</div>
<h2><a name="eci">Employment Cost Index - ECI</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">The ECI measures changes in employment costs of money wages and salaries and non-cash benefits in 
non-farm industries. The ECI does not include federal government workers.</div>
<h2><a name="empl_rep">Employment Report</a> </h2>
<div class="textarea">In the US, the employment report, also known as the labor report, is regarded as the most important among 
all economic indicators. The unemployment rate is one of the main components of the report and it 
measures the percentage of the civilian labor force actively looking for employment but unable to 
find jobs.</div>
<h2><a name="jobless">Jobless Claims</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">An important indicator of the US labor market condition. The Labor Department announces the number of 
jobless claims and its average during the last four weeks. This data gives information about the total 
level of unemployment in the country.</div>
<h2><a name="factory_orders">Factory Orders and Manufacturing Inventories</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">The factory orders report contains data on orders and shipments of durable and nondurable goods, 
manufacturing inventories, etc. Order data are useful because they tell us something about the likely 
pace of production in the months ahead.</div>

<h2><a name="gdp">Gross Domestic Product &ndash; GDP </a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Measures the market value of goods and services produced in the economy for a certain period of time, 
usually a year or a quarter. It does not include expenditures on durable assets. It includes only end 
consumption goods or investments.</div>
<h2><a name="hicp">Harmonized Index of Consumer Prices -  HICP</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">HICP is the official inflation measure for the Euro zone. The shift in price stability interpretation 
from below 2% to close to 2% gives the ECB added flexibility in tacking downside price risks.</div>
<h2><a name="housing_starts">Housing Starts and Building permits</a></h2>
 <div class="textarea">Starts are divided into single-family and multi-family categories. In both cases, a housing unit is 
considered &quot;started&quot; when excavation actually begins. Changes in interest rates, especially mortgage 
rates usually impact housing. Building permits are issued for all constructions (except the confidential)
, including temporary constructions, summer kitchens, single garages, etc.</div>
<h2><a name="leading_index">Index of Leading Economic Indicators</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">The LEI is a composite of 10 different indicators, designed to predict future aggregate economic 
activity. The LEI&rsquo;s individual components are selected from various sectors of the economy, 
including manufacturing, building, financial, retail and consumer variables. The components were chosen 
because of their economic relevance and statistical adequacy.</div>
<h2><a name="capacity">Industrial Production and Capacity Utilization</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Industrial production measures the monthly percentage change in volume of output of the nation&rsquo;s 
factories, mines, and utilities. Capacity utilization measures the extent to which the capital stock is 
employed in production.</div>
<h2><a name="new_home_sales">New Home Sales</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">This index shows the number of new-built homes sold during a certain month. The report also contains 
information on home prices, and number of houses for sale. Housing is a crucial segment of the economy 
because it signals changes in consumer spending patterns that are indicative of economic activity.</div>
<h2><a name="personal_income">Personal Income and Personal Consumption Expenditures</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Personal income represents the change in compensation that individuals receive from all sources 
including: wages and salaries; proprietors&rsquo; income; income from rents; dividends and interest; and 
transfer payments, etc. Personal consumption expenditures index measures the purchase of durable and 
nondurable goods, as well as services, by consumers.</div>
<h2><a name="ppi">Producer Price Index</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Measures the average price level of a certain basket of consumer and capital goods purchased by 
producers.</div>
<h2><a name="productivity">Productivity</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Quarterly measure of the change in the amount of goods and services produced per unit of input. The 
importance of productivity has grown over the past few years since the Federal Reserve has begun 
attributing its growth trend to relatively low levels of inflation.</div>
<h2><a name="retail_sales">Retail Sales</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Measures the percentage monthly change in total receipts of retail stores, and includes both durable and 
non-durable goods. It is the first real indication of the strength of consumer expenditure.</div>
<h2><a name="napm">National Association of Purchasing managers - NAPM</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Highly valued for its timeliness and breadth of information, the headline figure is a function of six 
major components: prices paid; new orders; supplier deliveries; production, inventories and employment. 
Note that the latter three components reflect supply forces, while the former three cover demand forces.
