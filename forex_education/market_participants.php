<div class="textarea">

 <strong>Market Makers</strong> are the foreign exchange dealers in commercial and investment institution dealing 
rooms <strong><a href="currency_transactions.php#quote">quote</a></strong> exchange rates in the inter-institution market, that is, between institutions. They <strong>quote</strong> prices at which they are prepared to buy 
or sell currencies and therefore make a market. The activity of <strong>forex dealers</strong> can be speculative where they try to 
make a profit from anticipating exchange rate movements.</div>
<h3>Market Makers Quote</h3>
 <div class="textarea">Another part of their activity involves <a href="currency_transactions.php#quote"> quoting prices </a> both internally and externally. Internally would involve <strong>quoting</strong> prices to the other dealing desks 
within the dealing room, for example, to the currency options desk, interest rate derivatives desk, forex 
forwards desk, money markets desk and the proprietary trading desk. Externally would involve quoting 
prices to their customer base, for example, international corporations or fund managers. In recent years, 
consolidation of the institutioning industry has led to a contraction of active <strong>market makers</strong>. The BIS 2001 
survey reveals that, in the UK, 17 institutions captured 75% of the market activity in 2001 compared to 24 institutions 
in 1998 and 20 institutions in 1995. In the US, the data indicates that 75% of<strong><a href="currency_transactions.php"> forex transactions </a></strong>was conducted by 
only 13 institutions in 2001 compared to 20 institutions in 1998 and 1995.</div>
<h2><a name="brokers">Brokers</a></h2> 
<div class="textarea"><strong>Brokers</strong> do not quote their own exchange rates; they are not market makers. Rather, they act as 
intermediaries between the <strong>market makers</strong> and relay the best prices, trying to match buy and sell orders.

The broker will not reveal the name of the counterparty making the quote until a positive commitment has 
been made by another counterparty. The broker makes a commission, charged to both counterparties to a 
transaction. In the past, <strong>brokers</strong> were particularly useful to smaller market makers who might otherwise 
have found it difficult to obtain a competitive market rate. However, the introduction of electronic 
broking in recent years, together with the introduction of the single currency (the euro), has greatly 
diminished the role of the voice broker.</div>
 <h2><a name="bank">Institutions</a></h2>
<div class="textarea"><strong>Institutions</strong> such as the <a href="http://www.ecb.europa.eu" target="_blank">European Central Bank (ECB)</a>, the <a href="http://www.federalreserve.gov/" target="_blank">US Federal Reserve 
 Bank (FED)</a>, the <a href="http://www.bankofengland.co.uk/" target="_blank">Bank of England (BOE)</a>, the Swiss National Bank, and the Bank of Japan. Central authorities enter the 
 <strong>foreign exchange market</strong> for several reasons to strengthen or weaken its own currency or to assist another central institution to do the same. 
to switch reserves from one currency to another. to smooth out any undesirable fluctuations in an exchange rate.</div>
  <h2><a name="corporation">Corporation</a></h2>
<div class="textarea"> Corporation - the companies involved in international trade will enter the forex market to manage their 
 cash flows. As a result of their international trade, these companies will be exposed to foreign exchange risk and will need to 
protect themselves against adverse movements in the forex market by hedging their positions. For example, 
Japanese companies are net exporters to the US and receive payment in US dollars. They naturally need to 
sell dollars against the yen and are therefore exposed to any weakening of the US dollar against the yen. 
Companies operating globally may also need to repatriate profits in other currencies to their base 
currency. For example, a company with its Head Office in London and subsidiaries in Europe and America 
may want to bring back its profits in euro and US dollars to its base currency, sterling, for balance 
sheet purposes. They will therefore need to buy sterling and sell euro and US dollars. Some companies 
have their own in-house dealing rooms and consequently will act as quasi-institutions in the market; they will 
take on currency risk and will be involved in trading and speculating.</div>
<h2><a name="fundmanagers">Fund managers</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Fund managers are institutions or individuals that manage investment portfolios either for their own 
account or on behalf of their customers. When they invest in the international stock and bond markets, 
they will have a natural need to move from one currency to another. Investment flows also arise from fund 
managers switching economies.</div>
<h2><a name="leverageaccount">Leveraged accounts</a></h2>
<div class="textarea">Leveraged accounts are high net worth individuals (private customers), as well as institutions, that are 
involved in what is called <strong><a href="margin_spread_pip.php">margin</a></strong> trading. This allows them to speculate in amounts that are far larger 
than their available capital. They will need to post collateral (usually US Treasuries) with the institution in a 
blocked account. The institution would agree a <strong>leverage</strong> multiple which both sides find acceptable. For example, 
the multiple might be 10 times or even 400 times.  This means that the investor can post collateral of USD 10 million and 
can subsequently trade up to USD 100 million or USD 400 millions in the <strong>forex market</strong>.
<h3>Leverage Example :</h3>
	<div class="example">
				Account Size :  10 000 $<br/>
				<strong>Leverage : &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;    10:1 - (with 1 $ trader can buy or sell currency equal to 10 $)</strong>
		  		<br/>
		  		Maximum Trade Size for the account :   10 000 $ X 10 = 100 000 $
